provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal
Information, to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy
Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement
to that transfer. We will take steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data
is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Our Application is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or 16 in
some EEA jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
from children under this age. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that
your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we become
aware that we have collected Personal Information from children without verification
of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.
