We’ll read deeply in the history of disability rights, the construction of normalcy, and theories of personhood and human worth that span the domains of philosophy, anthropology, feminist criticism, and more. And we’ll examine the long inventive tradition of making and remaking the built world enacted by disabled people in design at all scales: curb cuts, telecommunications, closed captioning, kitchen tools, and much more. Students will produce small experimental proposals in designing pragmatic forms\nof access and in interrogative cultural projects—for solving problems, when called for, and for asking larger investigative questions. Class work will be reading and discussion, shared presentations, written analysis, lightweight design experiments, field trips, and guest speakers.","maxCredits":4,"minCredits":1,"nupath":[],"sections":[{"crn":"17432","seatCapacity":16,"seatRemaining":3,"waitlistCapacity":6,"waitlistRemaining":6,"classType":"Studio","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Ryder Hall","room":"427","days":[3],"startTime":1335,"endTime":1705,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Hendren, Sara"},{"crn":"17433","seatCapacity":16,"seatRemaining":3,"waitlistCapacity":6,"waitlistRemaining":6,"classType":"Studio","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Ryder Hall","room":"236C","days":[3],"startTime":800,"endTime":1130,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Bhargava, Rahul"},{"crn":"17434","seatCapacity":16,"seatRemaining":15,"waitlistCapacity":6,"waitlistRemaining":6,"classType":"Studio","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Ryder Hall","room":"236C","days":[4],"startTime":1800,"endTime":2130,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Bertini, Enrico"},{"crn":"17435","seatCapacity":16,"seatRemaining":12,"waitlistCapacity":6,"waitlistRemaining":6,"classType":"Studio","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Ryder Hall","room":"236C","days":[1],"startTime":1335,"endTime":1705,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Forlano, Laura"},{"crn":"17436","seatCapacity":16,"seatRemaining":11,"waitlistCapacity":6,"waitlistRemaining":6,"classType":"Studio","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Ryder Hall","room":"427","days":[3,5],"startTime":1145,"endTime":1325,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Miranda Mouchrek, Najla"}]},{"name":"Information Design Studio 1: Principles","term":"202610","courseNumber":"5100","subject":"ARTG","description":"Explores the theories and practices of information design through studio projects.

Students will engage with foundational texts and key theorists, including Christina Sharpe’s metaphor of the wake, Paul Gilroy’s concept of the Black Atlantic, and Fred Moten’s theories of Blackness, to critically examine how Black identity and cultural production intersects†with visual media. Through weekly seminars, students will explore a diverse range of artists, theorists, activists, and institutions, considering how Black aesthetics have shaped art, music, literature, film, and emerging technologies. This course emphasizes the critical analysis of Black culture’s influence on contemporary media, such as social media, photography, gaming, and music, while building the skills necessary to write critically on topics in visual studies. By the end of the semester, students will gain a deeper understanding of the global and multifaceted impact of Black visual culture and develop the tools to analyze its role in shaping Western media and popular culture.

Course description: Edit, Filter, Curate: Cultural Production for Art and Design.\nThis course critically examines the ways Art and Design toggles between industrial, localized, and material practices and those that exist as digitized and mass mediated experiences. Organized around a series of thematic seminars, this course examines how cultural production interfaces within the public sphere. Each meeting takes as its focus a singular form of cultural production: the monographic exhibition, the international biennial, the exhibition catalogue, the edited anthology, the journal, the residency/lab, the community arts space, the commission. We will examine the changing role of the curator, editor, designer, and programmer operating on platforms that generate both online and offline encounters. The research thread of this course traces the ways mass digitalization and online platforms have impacted the way creative work is gathered stored, evaluated, sorted and circulated. We will examine the operations of Editing vs. Filtering vs. Curating as a means to think critically about the role of ‘knowledge production’ within the fields of art and design. A key aim is for students to establish their own research network map to support the public interface of their own work.","maxCredits":4,"minCredits":4,"nupath":[" NUpath Interpreting Culture"," NUpath Writing Intensive"],"sections":[{"crn":"14572","seatCapacity":16,"seatRemaining":0,"waitlistCapacity":6,"waitlistRemaining":0,"classType":"Lecture","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"","room":"","days":[2],"startTime":1335,"endTime":1655,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Sutton, Gloria"}]},{"name":"Media Art, Culture, and Social Justice","term":"202610","courseNumber":"1001","subject":"ARTD","description":"Introduces a wide range of perspectives on and practices of media art and social justice.

For each issue, studies cases and locations spread across the world, examines the links between past and present, and attempts to identify ways forward.","maxCredits":4,"minCredits":4,"nupath":[" NU Core Comp Stdy of Cultures"," NUpath Difference/Diversity"," NU Core Humanities Lvl 1"," NUpath Interpreting Culture"],"sections":[{"crn":"14405","seatCapacity":25,"seatRemaining":19,"waitlistCapacity":0,"waitlistRemaining":0,"classType":"Lecture","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"","room":"","days":[1,3,4],"startTime":915,"endTime":1020,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Heefner, Gretchen"}]},{"name":"Pirates, Planters, and Patriots: Making the Americas, 1492&#8211;1804","term":"202610","courseNumber":"1218","subject":"HIST","description":"Seeks to challenge students to understand more than the outlines of American history&#8212;Pilgrims, patriots, plantations&#8212; in the broader contexts of events that unfolded in and around the Atlantic Ocean in the Americas, Europe, and Africa.

Delves into the dynamics of group interaction and strategic multiagent decisions and the emergence of group behavior, particularly in network structures. Includes modeling dynamics of human-AI systems in multiagent setups and empirical analysis of governance mechanisms in sociotechnical systems.","maxCredits":4,"minCredits":4,"nupath":[],"sections":[{"crn":"18007","seatCapacity":10,"seatRemaining":10,"waitlistCapacity":0,"waitlistRemaining":0,"classType":"Lecture","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"","room":"","days":[3],"startTime":1335,"endTime":1655,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Heydari, Babak"}]},{"name":"Machine Learning Operations","term":"202610","courseNumber":"7374","subject":"IE","description":"Offers topics of interest to the staff member conducting this class for advanced study.
