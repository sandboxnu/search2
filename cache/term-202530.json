The seminar begins with human evolutionary history (the emergence of bipedalism, hairlessness, sweating, whole-body cooling, speech, and the control of fire) to explain how and why humans require structured shelter. This deep history serves as a basis for understanding building design as the resolution of physiological need and environmental milieu, which is topically relevant in the twenty-first century of changing climates. In doing so, it covers how humans began to speak to one another, develop cohorts, socialize, develop politics, and, along the way develop forms of inequality as humans began to build and alter landscapes. The first half of the course will present this framework historically through a global survey of buildings with premodern, modern, and nonmodern examples of humans adapting to certain environments from its earliest structures through the destructive, polluting, climate change-inducing practices of modern and contemporary practices. The second half of the course will be projective example for nonmodern practice in the decades ahead: a forest-first approach to timber building in the northeast.

This course is centered on four design projects: a weekly survey of a tree in the Northeastern Arboretum, one website redesign, one physical interaction project, and finally, a final project where students develop a publicly oriented interface - for example a website, an app, a wayfinding device - to communicate an environmental phenomenon to the public. Course material involve reading environmental history and theories, as well as learning more about the work of artists and designers who commune with the natural world.

Topics in Description: Mapping has long been entangled with colonial frameworks, surveillance, control, and power; activists, artists, and visionary thinkers have sought to liberate spatial representation through counter-mapping methods. Joining these efforts, this class explores other ways of mapping and cartographic activism, focusing on the pressing issues of bordering. Using frameworks of feminist geography, decoloniality, environmental justice, and data activism, the class speculates on marginalized landscapes on urban, territorial, and global scales. Short lectures, critical texts, and discussions accompany workshops to build digital, interactive, and physical co-mapping skills with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and beyond. This semester, the students work on the project Boston Coastline Atlas, which focuses on the theme of hydro-feminism, where students design a cartographic activism project to imagine the future of mapping otherwise. The studio’s goal is to reimagine Boston’s coastlines for the future of decolonial narratives, climate visions, and environmental justice centering around watery bodies.","maxCredits":4,"minCredits":4,"nupath":[],"sections":[{"crn":"36482","seatCapacity":16,"seatRemaining":5,"waitlistCapacity":4,"waitlistRemaining":4,"classType":"Studio","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Ryder Hall","room":"399A","days":[1],"startTime":1335,"endTime":1705,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Erkilic, Gokcen"}]},{"name":"Cause InForm: Dsgn & SocImpact","term":"202530","courseNumber":"3452","subject":"ARTG","description":"Focuses on a specific intermediate-level topic of timely relevance to the domain of graphic design.

Demonstrates the integration of topics through programming assignments in the C language that implement fundamental data structures (lists, queues, trees, maps, graphs) and algorithms as they are applied in computer systems. Additional breadth topics include programming applications that expose students to primitives of different subsystems using threads and sockets.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Section information

Starts with functional program design, introducing the notion of a design recipe. The latter consists of two parts: a task organization (ranging from the description of data to the creation of a test suite) and a data-oriented approach to the organization of programs (ranging from atomic data to self-referential data definitions and functions as data). The course then progresses to object-oriented design, explaining how it generalizes and contrasts with functional design. In addition to studying program design, students also have an opportunity to practice pair-programming and public code review techniques, as found in industry today.","maxCredits":4,"minCredits":4,"nupath":[],"sections":[{"crn":"35646","seatCapacity":114,"seatRemaining":19,"waitlistCapacity":80,"waitlistRemaining":80,"classType":"Lecture","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Shillman

Cryptography is the science of protecting information against adversarial eavesdropping and tampering. Examines what kind of security properties can be achieved by relying solely on probability and information theory, without restricting the adversary’s computational power. Studies the complexity-theoretic basis of modern cryptography and the connection between computational hardness and pseudo-randomness. Explores, as the main component of the course, how to take a few well-studied problems in number theory and algebra and use them to build powerful cryptosystems with advanced functionality and security properties.

The appropriation of the medieval is ubiquitous, and never ideologically innocent, running the gamut from Wagner’s Ring opera to the Med-Ren Faire to Dreamworks’ Shrek to the shields that white supremacists carried in Charlottesville. In this course, our focus is on the persistence of the Middle Ages as a mode and a theme in literature, music, art, and architecture, as well as in film, video games, and other artifacts of popular culture. We will consider such topics as aesthetics, pleasure, danger, canonization, genre, colonialism, the gothic, fantasy literature (almost always medieval-ish!), and modern responses to medieval representations of class, race, gender, and sexual preference and identity. We will pair “host” texts and “symbiont” texts, such as Malory’s Morte Darthur and a selection of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales with their reworkings, including film. As we read such texts as the French Tristan and Iseult and Roman de Silence (a tale of born-sex vs. cultural assignment), we will explore how—and why—we read medieval texts now.

In this course we will interrogate, as the Romantics did, notions of the Wild.\n \nAs a class, we will attempt neither to categorize nor define what is wild, either as the Romantics understood it then or how we understand it today; rather, we will explore how Romantic literature allows us to form further questions and stage interventions to contemporary conversations about wildness. How did catastrophe and social shifts provoke Romantic writers to imagine new forms of community? How might we learn from these provocations/responses?\n \nWe will consider the intersections of large and small revolutions, turning points, and moments, including political revolutions and revolutions of manners, science, and industry. \n \nWe will muse on the ways in which poets of the era engage with notions of the ethical, the fantastic, the nation, resistance, spiritualism, sympathy, and sex. We focus on ideas about nature, climate, limits of the human, and the roles of the writer and artist in the political project. \n \nWe will examine pseudo-scientific treatises and geological catalogues of “deep time”; look at poetry, drama, film, and fiction from canonical and lesser known writers from the Romantic era and their echos in the present. We’ll move through poems about mermaid worlds, elegies for a lost wild, tracts for vegetarianism, postcolonial interrogations of nature poems, video games about alternative worlds, Victorian ghost stories and contemporary fictions about the ends of the world as we know it.\n \nThe class is informed by critical race theory, queer theory, feminist theory, and disability theory; we will consider the particular uses of presentism and theories of vulnerability, animal theory and work that explores “the planetary turn” and geo-aesthetics.","maxCredits":4,"minCredits":4,"nupath":[],"sections":[{"crn":"39566","seatCapacity":15,"seatRemaining":1,"waitlistCapacity":5,"waitlistRemaining":5,"classType":"Seminar","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Cahners Hall","room":"001","days":[2],"startTime":1750,"endTime":2110,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Saxton, Kirsten"}]},{"name":"ST: Literacy in the Age of AI","term":"202530","courseNumber":"7395","subject":"ENGL","description":"May include the following topics: literacy and literacies; basic writing; issues of gender, race, and class in the classroom; writing assessment; or collaborative learning.

We’ll situate our inquiry in the history of writing machines (Hayles) and teaching machines (Watters), but our focus will be on recent developments such as generative AI, algorithmic attention systems, automated scoring of writing, AI-assisted composing, and virtual Teaching Assistants. On the broadest conceptual level, we’ll explore how these developments are reshaping what it means to think, read, write, teach, and learn—and thus what it means to study and teach in English Studies. We’ll also consider how they might support or undermine antiracist, justice-oriented, and decolonial work in rhetoric and writing studies. Students will experiment with the use of AI in their own projects and reflect on how it could impact their professional trajectories. In addition to the history mentioned, we’ll read texts like Naomi Baron’s Who Wrote This?; Duin and Pederson’s Writing Futures: Collaborative, Algorithmic, Autonomous; Vee et al.’s TextGenEd: Teaching with Text Generation Technologies; and selections from recent special issues of Computer and Composition (composing with generative AI) and Double Helix (critical thinking, writing, and AI). We’ll also look at the hype and the apocalypticism surrounding AI in popular and higher ed discourse. This is an exploratory course; no technical expertise in AI required.","maxCredits":4,"minCredits":4,"nupath":[],"sections":[{"crn":"39567","seatCapacity":15,"seatRemaining":6,"waitlistCapacity":5,"waitlistRemaining":5,"classType":"Seminar","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Holmes Hall","room":"400B","days":[3],"startTime":1530,"endTime":1850,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Gallagher, Chris"},{"crn":"39568","seatCapacity":15,"seatRemaining":1,"waitlistCapacity":5,"waitlistRemaining":5,"classType":"Seminar","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Holmes Hall","room":"400B","days":[2],"startTime":1335,"endTime":1655,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Zhang-Wu, Qianqian"}]},{"name":"Directed Study","term":"202530","courseNumber":"7976","subject":"ENGL","description":"Offered by arrangement.

The course material spans selections in canonical essays from the 19th century to the global and mixed media writing of our own time, whether in text, video, audio, or social media formats. Weeks are organized by thematic topic, some formal (“tower,” “park”) and some social (“aging,” “recreation”). \n \nReading assignments will include written commentary on selected excerpts, analyzing narrative and structural strategies employed by writers such as persuasion, education, polemic, and others. Writing assignments will include short exercises in critical commentary and guidance in writing narratives for presenting current student projects (thesis or other course work). Both reading and writing exercises are designed to help graduate students build a mixed body of design research and practice, understanding the subtleties of communication choices as writing, no matter the medium or format.","maxCredits":4,"minCredits":3,"nupath":[" NU Core Experiential Learning"," NUpath Integration Experience"],"sections":[{"crn":"37928","seatCapacity":12,"seatRemaining":10,"waitlistCapacity":0,"waitlistRemaining":0,"classType":"Lecture","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Ryder Hall","room":"145","days":[2],"startTime":1525,"endTime":1845,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Hendren, Sara"},{"crn":"38217","seatCapacity":12,"seatRemaining":3,"waitlistCapacity":0,"waitlistRemaining":0,"classType":"Lecture","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Ryder Hall","room":"299","days":[3],"startTime":1335,"endTime":1655,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Kana, Patrick"},{"crn":"35900","seatCapacity":7,"seatRemaining":3,"waitlistCapacity":0,"waitlistRemaining":0,"classType":"Lecture","honors":false,"campus":"Oakland, CA","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Aron Art Center C Ceramics","room":"179","days":[4],"startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"final":true,"finalDate":"04/17/2025"},{"building":"Aron Art Center C Ceramics","room":"179","days":[1],"startTime":1335,"endTime":1655,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Logan, Emma"},{"crn":"35953","seatCapacity":12,"seatRemaining":8,"waitlistCapacity":0,"waitlistRemaining":0,"classType":"Lecture","honors":false,"campus":"Oakland, CA","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Aron Art Center C Ceramics","room":"183","days":[5],"startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"final":true,"finalDate":"04/25/2025"},{"building":"Aron Art Center C Ceramics","room":"183","days":[4],"startTime":1035,"endTime":1405,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Hardy, Brooke"},{"crn":"36216","seatCapacity":12,"seatRemaining":7,"waitlistCapacity":0,"waitlistRemaining":0,"classType":"Lecture","honors":false,"campus":"Oakland, CA","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Aron Art Center F Photography","room":"141","days":[2],"startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"final":true,"finalDate":"04/22/2025"},{"building":"Aron Art Center F Photography","room":"141","days":[5],"startTime":845,"endTime":1215,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Cesario, Christa"},{"crn":"38120","seatCapacity":12,"seatRemaining":9,"waitlistCapacity":0,"waitlistRemaining":0,"classType":"Lecture","honors":false,"campus":"Oakland, CA","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Aron Art Center E Painting","room":"166","days":[1],"startTime":1615,"endTime":1935,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Rhoades, Katherine"},{"crn":"38121","seatCapacity":12,"seatRemaining":8,"waitlistCapacity":0,"waitlistRemaining":0,"classType":"Lecture","honors":false,"campus":"Oakland, CA","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Graduate School of Business","room":"241","days":[4],"startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"final":true,"finalDate":"04/17/2025"},{"building":"Graduate School of Business","room":"241","days":[3],"startTime":1615,"endTime":1935,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Lucas, Kija"}]},{"name":"Interdisciplinary Critique Studio","term":"202530","courseNumber":"6000","subject":"INAM","description":"Builds critical analysis skills and introduces students to rigorous artistic dialog.

While the focus is on development in the so-called “developing world”; we will also explore some strategies for addressing development in a local community context. Course concludes by applying what we have learned to address several development case studies posing particular problems in particular regions and contexts.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Section information text:\r\n        Meets in room DK 230","maxCredits":3,"minCredits":3,"nupath":[],"sections":[{"crn":"41047","seatCapacity":4,"seatRemaining":3,"waitlistCapacity":4,"waitlistRemaining":4,"classType":"Lecture","honors":false,"campus":"Boston","meetingTimes":[{"building":"Boston","room":"DEPT","days":[1,3],"startTime":1110,"endTime":1235,"final":false,"finalDate":null}],"faculty":"Danielsen, Dan"}]},{"name":"Drug Law and Policy","term":"202530","courseNumber":"7606","subject":"LW","description":"The field of Drug Law is vast, spanning the discovery, manufacture, distribution, and consumption of chemical agents designed to alter the human condition.
